 * Simple Views and UI to test and use the existing functionality.

## Next steps

 * Finish game logic such us winner detection and turns to play
 * API implementation (Django Rest Framework)
 * Game authentication and secuirity
 * Better UI, with the usage or a front-end framework
 * More unit test and functional tests.
 * Other good practices can be added like automatic deployments, continous integration, etc.
